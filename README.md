# Scraping sports (NFL and MLB) odds from sportsbook

Update 2024-12-05: It was good while it lasted. Betclic has changed their API, so I'm not able to scrape their odds (at least for the moment).
I've started an exploration.py script to see if I could get around their new validations. Let's see how that evolves.
New Security Validations: Cloudfront

Update 2024-09-08: I renamed the repository as I've just added a scraper for NFL game odds to go with the one for MLB games that was already in place. 

**Short-term Goal**: analyzing how the moneyline and odds move over time for a certain game  

**Long-term Goal**: seeing if we could make f*cking money with this ü§ë

Using Python and Github Actions for now

- [x] Add fallback for when API call returns no rows
- [ ] Start analyzing results to see trends on odds for one side or another
